# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0b1]

### Added
`IndexedData` class to represent collections of signals with two levels of hierarchy. But there is no reason for this to be a different class. In the future, we can just supercharge the `Data` class to have this additional functionality. 


## [1.0.2] - 2025-03-12
 
First major release.
